    "problem": "For $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$ and each of its non-empty subsets a unique alternating sum is defined as follows. Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. For example, the alternating sum for $\\{1, 2, 3, 6,9\\}$ is $9-6+3-2+1=5$ and for $\\{5\\}$ it is simply $5$. Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $n=7$.",
    "solution": "Consider a given subset $T$ of $S$ that contains $7$; then there is a subset $T'$ which contains all the elements of $T$ except for $7$, and only those elements . Since each element of $T'$ has one fewer element preceding it than it does in $T$, their signs are opposite. Thus the sum of the alternating sums of $T$ and $T'$ is equal to 7. There are $2^6$ subsets containing 7, so our answer is $7 \\cdot 2^6 = \\boxed{448}$.",
