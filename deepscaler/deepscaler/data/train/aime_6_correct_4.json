        "solution": "Let $n$ be an integer that cannot be written as the sum of two odd composite numbers. If $n>33$, then $n-9,n-15,n-21,n-25,n-27,$ and $n-33$ must all be prime (or $n-33=1$, which yields $n=34=9+25$ which does not work). Thus $n-9,n-15,n-21,n-27,$ and $n-33$ form a prime quintuplet. However, only one prime quintuplet exists as exactly one of those 5 numbers must be divisible by 5.This prime quintuplet is $5,11,17,23,$ and $29$, yielding a maximal answer of 38. Since $38-25=13$, which is prime, the answer is $\\boxed{038}$.",

        "solution": "We first show that we can choose at most 5 numbers from $\\{1, 2, \\ldots , 11\\}$ such that no two numbers have a difference of $4$ or $7$. We take the smallest number to be $1$, which rules out $5,8$. Now we can take at most one from each of the pairs: $[2,9]$, $[3,7]$, $[4,11]$, $[6,10]$. Now, $1989 = 180\\cdot 11 + 9$. Because this isn't an exact multiple of $11$, we need to consider some numbers separately.\n Notice that $1969 = 180\\cdot11 - 11 = 179\\cdot11$. Therefore we can put the last $1969$ numbers into groups of 11. Now let's examine $\\{1, 2, \\ldots , 20\\}$. If we pick $1, 3, 4, 6, 9$ from the first $11$ numbers, then we're allowed to pick $11 + 1$, $11 + 3$, $11 + 4$, $11 + 6$, $11 + 9$. This means we get 10 members from the 20 numbers.

In general, the number of ways we can arrange people within the rings to count properly is $\\dfrac{(n-1)!}{2}$, since there are $(n-1)!$ ways to arrange items in the circle, and then we don't want to want to consider reflections as separate entities.

For organization within the ring, as before, there is only one way to arrange the ring of three. For six, there is $\\dfrac{(6-1)!}{2}=60$. This means there are $(84)(1)(60)=5040$ arrangements.\nCase 3: For four and five, there are $\\dbinom{9}{5}=126$ sets for the rings.

To search for bad collections, we can start at an arbitrary right shoe (say $R_1$), check the left shoe it is paired with (say $L_i$), and from the previous observation, we know that $R_i$ must also be in the bad collection. Then we may check the left shoe paired with $R_i$, find its counterpart, check its left pair, find its counterpart, etc. until we have found $L_1$.

(Note: This is the cycle notation of permutations.) The only condition for a bad pairing is that there is a cycle with length less than $5$; thus, we need to count pairings where every cycle has length at least $5$.

The area of a regular pentagon with side lengths $s$ is $\\frac{5s^2}{4\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}}}$. $5-2\\sqrt{5}$ is slightly greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$ given that $2\\sqrt{5}$ is slightly less than $\\frac{9}{2}$. $4\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}}$ is then slightly greater than $2\\sqrt{2}$. We will approximate that to be $2.9$. The area is now roughly $\\frac{180}{2.9}$, but because the actual pentagon is not regular, but has the same perimeter of the regular one that we are comparing to we can say that this is an overestimate on the area and turn the $2.9$ into $3$ thus turning the area into $\\frac{180}{3}$ which is $60$ and since $60$ is a multiple of the semiperimeter $15$, we can safely say that the answer is most likely $\\boxed{60}$.\n ~Lopkiloinm",
