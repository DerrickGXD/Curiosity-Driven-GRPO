    "problem": "For $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$ and each of its non-empty subsets a unique alternating sum is defined as follows. Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. For example, the alternating sum for $\\{1, 2, 3, 6,9\\}$ is $9-6+3-2+1=5$ and for $\\{5\\}$ it is simply $5$. Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $n=7$.",
    "solution": "Consider a given subset $T$ of $S$ that contains $7$; then there is a subset $T'$ which contains all the elements of $T$ except for $7$, and only those elements . Since each element of $T'$ has one fewer element preceding it than it does in $T$, their signs are opposite. Thus the sum of the alternating sums of $T$ and $T'$ is equal to 7. There are $2^6$ subsets containing 7, so our answer is $7 \\cdot 2^6 = \\boxed{448}$.",

      "response": " The problem asks for the sum of all alternating sums of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 7\\}$, where each subset of the set is paired with its complement to form a unique alternating sum. \n\nFirst, let's consider the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. We can pair each subset with its complement to form a unique alternating sum. For example, the subset $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ can be paired with its complement $\\{7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\\}$, and the alternating sum of this pair is $7-6+5-4+3-2+1=5$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ again. We can pair each subset with its complement to form a unique alternating sum. For example, the subset $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ can be paired with its complement $\\{7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\\}$, and the alternating sum of this pair is $7-6+5-4+3-2+1=5$.\n\nWe can continue this process for all subsets of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 7\\}$. The sum of all these alternating sums is the sum of all possible pairs of subsets, which is the sum of all possible pairs of subsets of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 7\\}$.\n\nThe number of subsets of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 7\\}$ is $2^7 = 128$. Each pair of subsets corresponds to a unique alternating sum, so the sum of all alternating sums is the sum of all possible pairs of subsets of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 7\\}$.\n\nThe sum of all possible pairs of subsets of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 7\\}$ is the sum of all possible pairs of subsets of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 7\\}$, which is the sum of all possible pairs of subsets

Then $S$ must have more than 4 elements, otherwise its sum would be at most $15+14+13+12=54$.\n$S$ can't have more than 5 elements.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, two of these subsets would have the same sum. If those subsets were disjoint, we would directly arrive at a contradiction; if not, we could remove the common elements to get two disjoint subsets.\n Thus, $S$ would have to have 5 elements. $S$ contains both 15 and 14 (otherwise its sum is at most $10+11+12+13+15=61$). It follows that $S$ cannot contain both $a$ and $a-1$ for any $a\\leq 13$, or the subsets $\\{a,14\\}$ and $\\{a-1,15\\}$ would have the same sum.

How many different sequences of 15 coin tosses will contain exactly two HH, three HT, four TH, and five TT subsequences?",
    "solution": "Let's consider each of the sequences of two coin tosses as an operation instead; this operation takes a string and adds the next coin toss on (eg, THHTH + HT = THHTHT). We examine what happens to the last coin toss. Adding HH or TT is simply an identity for the last coin toss, so we will ignore them for now. However, adding HT or TH switches the last coin. H switches to T three times, but T switches to H four times; hence it follows that our string will have a structure of THTHTHTH.\n Now we have to count all of the different ways we can add the identities back in. There are 5 TT subsequences, which means that we have to add 5 T into the strings, as long as the new Ts are adjacent to existing Ts. There are already 4 Ts in the sequence, and since order doesn’t matter between different tail flips this just becomes the ball-and-urn argument. We want to add 5 balls into 4 urns, which is the same as 3 dividers; hence this gives ${{5+3}\\choose3} = 56$ combinations.

    "problem": "A given sequence $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$ of distinct real numbers can be put in ascending order by means of one or more \"bubble passes\". A bubble pass through a given sequence consists of comparing the second term with the first term, and exchanging them if and only if the second term is smaller, then comparing the third term with the second term and exchanging them if and only if the third term is smaller, and so on in order, through comparing the last term, $r_n$, with its current predecessor and exchanging them if and only if the last term is smaller.\n The example below shows how the sequence 1, 9, 8, 7 is transformed into the sequence 1, 8, 7, 9 by one bubble pass. The numbers compared at each step are underlined.\n$\\underline{1 \\quad 9} \\quad 8 \\quad 7$\n$1 \\quad {}\\underline{9 \\quad 8} \\quad 7$\n$1 \\quad 8 \\quad \\underline{9 \\quad 7}$\n$1 \\quad 8 \\quad 7 \\quad 9$\n Suppose that $n = 40$, and that the terms of the initial sequence $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_{40}$ are distinct from one another and are in random order. Let $p/q$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the number that begins as $r_{20}$ will end up, after one bubble pass, in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place. Find $p + q$.",
    "solution": "If any of $r_1, \\ldots, r_{19}$ is larger than $r_{20}$, one of these numbers will be compared with $r_{20}$ on the 19th step of the first bubble pass and $r_{20}$ will be moved back to the 19th position. Thus, $r_{20}$ must be the largest of the first 20 terms. In addition, $r_{20}$ must be larger than $r_{21}, r_{22}, \\ldots, r_{30}$ but smaller than $r_{31}$ in order that it move right to the 30th position but then not continue moving right to the 31st.\n Thus, our problem can be restated: What is the probability that in a sequence of 31 distinct real numbers, the largest is in position 31 and the second-largest is in position 20 (the other 29 numbers are irrelevant)?\n This is much easier to solve: there are $31!$ ways to order the first thirty-one numbers and $29!$ ways to arrange them so that the largest number is in the 31st position and the second-largest is in the 20th. This gives us a desired probability of $\\frac{29!}{31!} = \\frac{1}{31\\cdot 30} = \\frac{1}{930}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{931}$.",

The area of $S_1$ is given as $441$, and the area of $S_2$ is given as $440$.\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square.

Therefore, one of $1993 - n$ or $1994 + n$ is odd, and each of them must be a multiple of $125$ or $16$.\n For $1993 - n$ to be a multiple of $125$ and $1994 + n$ to be a multiple of $16$, $n \\equiv 118 \\pmod {125}$ and $n\\equiv 6 \\pmod {16}$.

Then $\\angle CAB = \\angle DBC = 2\\theta$, $\\angle AOB = 180 - 3\\theta$, and $\\angle ACB = 180 - 5\\theta$. Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, it follows that $OA = OC$. By the Law of Sines on $\\triangle ABO,\\, \\triangle BCO$,\n$\\frac{\\sin \\angle CBO}{OC} = \\frac{\\sin \\angle ACB}{OB} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\sin \\angle DBA}{OC} = \\frac{\\sin \\angle BAC}{OB}.$\n Dividing the two equalities yields\n\\[\\frac{\\sin 2\\theta}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{\\sin (180 - 5\\theta)}{\\sin 2\\theta} \\Longrightarrow \\sin^2 2\\theta = \\sin 5\\theta \\sin \\theta.\\]\n Pythagorean and product-to-sum identities yield\n\\[1 - \\cos^2 2 \\theta = \\frac{\\cos 4\\theta - \\cos 6 \\theta}{2},\\]\n and the double and triple angle ($\\cos 3x = 4\\cos^3 x - 3\\cos x$) formulas further simplify this to\n\\[4\\cos^3 2\\theta - 4\\cos^2 2\\theta - 3\\cos 2\\theta + 3 = (4\\cos^2 2\\theta - 3)(\\cos 2\\theta - 1) = 0\\]\n The only value of $\\theta$ that fits in this context comes from $4 \\cos^2 2\\theta - 3 = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\cos 2\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\Longrightarrow \\theta = 15^{\\circ}$. The answer is $\\lfloor 1000r \\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 1000 \\cdot \\frac{180 - 5\\theta}{180 - 3\\theta} \\right\\rfloor = \\left \\lfloor \\frac{7000}{9} \\right \\rfloor = \\boxed{777}$.",
