    "problem": "Each vertex of a regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) is to be colored either red or blue, and thus there are $2^{12}$ possible colorings. Find the number of these colorings with the property that no four vertices colored the same color are the four vertices of a rectangle.",
    "solution": "Note that the condition is equivalent to stating that there are no 2 pairs of oppositely spaced vertices with the same color.\n Case 1: There are no pairs. This yields $2$ options for each vertices 1-6, and the remaining vertices 7-12 are set, yielding $2^6=64$ cases.\n Case 2: There is one pair. Again start with 2 options for each vertex in 1-6, but now multiply by 6 since there are 6 possibilities for which pair can have the same color assigned instead of the opposite. Thus, the cases are: $2^6*6=384$\n case 3: There are two pairs, but oppositely colored. Start with $2^6$ for assigning 1-6, then multiply by 6C2=15 for assigning which have repeated colors. Divide by 2 due to half the cases having the same colored opposites. $2^6*15/2=480$\n It is apparent that no other cases exist, as more pairs would force there to be 2 pairs of same colored oppositely spaced vertices with the same color. Thus, the answer is: $64+384+480=\\boxed{928}$\n ~SAHANWIJETUNGA",
