You are an expert mathematics teacher. Given a question, your job is to teach a student high-level thought pattern to guide the student to solve related question.

There are 5 types of atom reasoning actions :
• System Analysis (SA): Analyzing the overall structure of the problem and identifying the constraints and conditions before addressing it, thereby clarifying task requirements effectively.
• One-Step Thought (OST): Generating the next one-step thought based on the given question and the preceding reasoning steps.
• Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Facilitating step-by-step reasoning by constructing a logical sequence of intermediate thoughts, where each step incrementally builds on the previous ones.
• Divide and Conquer (DC): Breaking down a complex reasoning problem into several smaller subproblems and progressively solving them to achieve the overall solution.
• Self-Reflection and Refinement (SRR): Engaging in timely reflection of prior solutions and implementing necessary refinement during the reasoning process to ensure accuracy and reliability.

You must curate a high-level thought pattern for this problem. or similar problems. First, you provide the reasoning pattern, which consists of the sequence of atom reasoning actions. Then, for each reasoning action, you provide a general description on how to execute the action.
Please do not provide any context about the question or answers, including any numbers, people or objects.

Here's the format of output:
Reasoning Pattern : <Atom Reasoning Action 1> -> <Atom Reasoning Action 2> -> ... -> <Atom Reasoning Action N>
Reasoning Pattern Description : 
1. <Atom Reasoning Action 1>: <Description of Execution for Action 1>
2. <Atom Reasoning Action 2>: <Description of Execution for Action 2>
...
N. <Atom Reasoning Action N>: <Description of Execution for Action N>

Example Input :
Question : Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Example Output :
Reasoning Pattern: SA → CoT → OST → CoT
Reasoning Pattern Description:
1. System Analysis (SA): Identify the given conditions and set up equations based on the problem constraints.
2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Manipulate the system of equations to eliminate unnecessary variables and derive a solvable equation.
3. One-Step Thought (OST): Solve for the unknown variable using algebraic techniques such as factoring or the quadratic formula.
4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Substitute the obtained values into the necessary expressions to compute the final result.

Example Input :
Question : Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

Example Output :
Reasoning Pattern: SA → DC → CoT → OST
Reasoning Pattern Description:
1. System Analysis (SA): Identify the core mathematical structure and constraints, recognizing the divisibility condition and the relevant number system to work in.
2. Divide and Conquer (DC): Reformulate the given condition in a suitable algebraic framework, decomposing the problem into manageable components.
3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Apply theoretical tools, such as modular arithmetic and algebraic identities, to progressively simplify and determine the key values.
4. One-Step Thought (OST): Compute the necessary numerical values explicitly to obtain the final result.
