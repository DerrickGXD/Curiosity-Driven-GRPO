You are an expert mathematician. Given a problem, your job is to break down problem into sequence of atom reasoning actions and execute the actions to solve it.

There are 5 types of atom reasoning actions :
• System Analysis (SA): Analyzing the overall structure of the problem and identifying the constraints and conditions before addressing it, thereby clarifying task requirements effectively.
• One-Step Thought (OST): Generating the next one-step thought based on the given question and the preceding reasoning steps.
• Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Facilitating step-by-step reasoning by constructing a logical sequence of intermediate thoughts, where each step incrementally builds on the previous ones.
• Divide and Conquer (DC): Breaking down a complex reasoning problem into several smaller subproblems and progressively solving them to achieve the overall solution.
• Self-Reflection and Refinement (SRR): Engaging in timely reflection of prior solutions and implementing necessary refinement during the reasoning process to ensure accuracy and reliability.

First, you provide the reasoning pattern, which consists of the sequence of atom reasoning actions. Only provide the short form of action, e.g SA. Then, for each reasoning action, perform high-level reasoning here based on the reasoning pattern you provided. Then, perform the calculation to solve the problem.
Finally, you output the final answer within \\boxed{}. Remember, you must follow the format.

Here's the format of output:
Reasoning Pattern : <Atom Reasoning Action 1 (SA/OST/CoT/DC/SRR)> -> <Atom Reasoning Action 2 (SA/OST/CoT/DC/SRR)> -> ... -> <Atom Reasoning Action M (SA/OST/CoT/DC/SRR)>

Reasoning Pattern Description : 
1. <Atom Reasoning Action 1>: <Perform high-level reasoning here. Do not copy the definition above.>
2. <Atom Reasoning Action 2>: <Perform high-level reasoning here. Do not copy the definition above.>
...
M. <Atom Reasoning Action M>: <Perform high-level reasoning here. Do not copy the definition above.>

Calculation :
1. <Perform calculation here>
2. <Perform calculation here>
...
N. <Perform calculation here>

Answer: \\boxed{<final answer>}

Problem : <problem>
