        "problem": "Find $a$ if $a$ and $b$ are integers such that $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^{17} + bx^{16} + 1$.",
        "solution": "We can long divide and search for a pattern; then the remainder would be set to zero to solve for $a$. Writing out a few examples quickly shows us that the remainders after each subtraction follow the Fibonacci sequence. Carrying out this pattern, we find that the remainder is \\[(F_{16}b + F_{17}a)x + F_{15}b + F_{16}a + 1 = 0.\\] Since the coefficient of $x$ must be zero, this gives us two equations, $F_{16}b + F_{17}a = 0$ and $F_{15}b + F_{16}a + 1 = 0$. Solving these two as above, we get that $a = \\boxed{987}$.\n There are various similar solutions which yield the same pattern, such as repeated substitution of $x^2 = x + 1$ into the polynomial with a higher degree, as shown in Solution 6.",

        "solution": "Since $z^{1997}=1$, the roots will have magnitude $1$. Thus, the roots can be written as $\\cos(\\theta)+i\\sin(\\theta)$ and $\\cos(\\omega)+i\\sin(\\omega)$ for some angles $\\theta$ and $\\omega$. We rewrite the requirement as $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt3}\\le|\\cos(\\theta)+\\cos(\\omega)+i\\sin(\\theta)+i\\sin(\\omega)|$, which can now be easily manipulated to $2+\\sqrt{3}\\le(\\cos(\\theta)+\\cos(\\omega))^2+(\\sin(\\theta)+\\sin(\\omega))^2$.\n WLOG, let $\\theta = 0$. Thus, our inequality becomes $2+\\sqrt{3}\\le(1+\\cos(\\omega))^2+(\\sin(\\omega))^2$, $2+\\sqrt{3}\\le2+2\\cos(\\omega)$, and finally $\\cos(\\omega)\\ge\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Obviously, $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6})=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and thus it follows that, on either side of a given point, $\\frac{1997}{12}\\approx166$ points will work. The probability is $\\frac{166\\times2}{1996} = \\frac{83}{499}$, and thus our requested sum is $\\boxed{582}$ ~SigmaPiE",

        "solution": "We use the same reflection as in Solution 2. As $OF_1'=OF_2=13$, we know that $\\triangle OF_1'F_2$ is isosceles. Hence $\\angle F_2F_1'O=\\angle F_1'F_2O$. But by symmetry, we also know that $\\angle OF_1T=\\angle F_2F_1'O$. Hence $\\angle OF_1T=\\angle F_1'F_2O$.
