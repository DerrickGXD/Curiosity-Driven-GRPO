Find $p+q$.",
        "solution": "Similar to Solution 1, we can find the average value of $|a_2 - a_1|$, and multiply this by 5 due to symmetry. And again due to symmetry, we can arbitrarily choose $a_2 > a_1$. Thus there are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to pick the two values of $a_2$ and $a_1$ from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ such that $a_2 > a_1$. First fix $a_2 = 10$, and vary $a_1$ from $1$ to $9$. Then fix $a_2 = 9$, and vary $a_1$ from $1$ to $8$. Continue, and you find that the sum of these $45$ ways to pick $|a_2 - a_1|$ is:\n$\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{9}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{k}j = 45+36+28+21+15+10+6+3+1 = 165$.\n Thus, each term contributes on average $\\frac{165}{45}$, and the sum will be five times this, or $\\frac{165}{9} = \\frac{55}{3}$.\n The final answer is $p+q = \\boxed{058}$.",

        "problem": "Forty teams play a tournament in which every team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, and each team has a $50 \\%$ chance of winning any game it plays. The probability that no two teams win the same number of games is $\\frac mn,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $\\log_2 n.$",
        "solution": "There are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total pairings of teams, and thus $2^{780}$ possible outcomes. In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games. Since the minimum and maximum possible number of games won are 0 and 39 respectively, and there are 40 teams in total, each team corresponds uniquely with some $k$, with $0 \\leq k \\leq 39$, where $k$ represents the number of games the team won. With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games. Further, note that these are all the valid combinations, as the team with 1 win must beat the team with 0 wins, the team with 2 wins must beat the teams with 1 and 0 wins, and so on; thus, this uniquely defines a combination.\n The desired probability is thus $\\frac{40!}{2^{780}}$. We wish to simplify this into the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. The only necessary step is to factor out all the powers of 2 from $40!$; the remaining number is clearly relatively prime to all powers of 2.\n The number of powers of 2 in $40!$ is $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right \\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.$\n$780-38 = \\boxed{742}$.",

        "solution": "This method does not rigorously get the answer, but it works. As the bug makes more and more moves, the probability of it going back to the origin approaches closer and closer to 1/3. Therefore, after 10 moves, the probability gets close to $341.33/1024$. We can either round up or down. If we round down, we see $341/1024$ cannot be reduced any further and because the only answers on the AIME are below 1000, this cannot be the right answer.
