    "problem": "For $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$ and each of its non-empty subsets a unique alternating sum is defined as follows. Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. For example, the alternating sum for $\\{1, 2, 3, 6,9\\}$ is $9-6+3-2+1=5$ and for $\\{5\\}$ it is simply $5$. Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $n=7$.",
    "solution": "Consider a given subset $T$ of $S$ that contains $7$; then there is a subset $T'$ which contains all the elements of $T$ except for $7$, and only those elements . Since each element of $T'$ has one fewer element preceding it than it does in $T$, their signs are opposite. Thus the sum of the alternating sums of $T$ and $T'$ is equal to 7. There are $2^6$ subsets containing 7, so our answer is $7 \\cdot 2^6 = \\boxed{448}$.",

Let's start by noting that since \\(AD\\) is bisected by \\(BC\\), the perpendicular from the center of the circle to \\(AD\\) will also bisect \\(AD\\). Let's denote the center of the circle as \\(O\\), and the point where \\(BC\\) intersects \\(AD\\) as \\(F\\). Since \\(AD\\) is bisected by \\(BC\\), \\(F\\) is the midpoint of \\(AD\\).\n\nGiven that the radius of the circle is 5, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \\(OFA\\). Let \\(OF = h\\) and \\(AF = \\frac{AD}{2}\\). Since \\(AD\\) is bisected by \\(BC\\), and \\(BC = 6\\), we can use the power of a point theorem at point \\(B\\):\n\n\\[ BF \\cdot FC = AB \\cdot BD \\]\n\nSince \\(F\\) is the midpoint of \\(AD\\), let \\(AD = 2x\\), so \\(AF = x\\).

Since \\(AD\\) is the only chord starting at \\(A\\) which is bisected by \\(BC\\), and using the fact that the sine of the central angle of minor arc \\(AB\\) is a rational number, we can use the fact that the sine of the angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in the right triangle formed by the radius and the chord.\n\nUsing the fact that the sine of the central angle of minor arc \\(AB\\) is a rational number, we can use the fact that the sine of the angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in the right triangle formed by the radius and the chord.
