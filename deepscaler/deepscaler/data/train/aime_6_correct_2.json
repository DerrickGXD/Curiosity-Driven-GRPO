(This also makes sense based on a combinatorial argument: the number of ways a number can \"travel\" to the top position going only up is equal to the number of times it will be counted in the final sum.)\n Examine the equation $\\mod 3$. All of the coefficients from $x_2 \\ldots x_8$ will be multiples of $3$ (since the numerator will have a $9$). Thus, the expression boils down to $x_0 + 10x_1 + 10x_9 + x_{10} \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$. Reduce to find that $x_0 + x_1 + x_9 + x_{10} \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$. Out of $x_0,\\ x_1,\\ x_9,\\ x_{10}$, either all are equal to $0$, or three of them are equal to $1$.

Therefore, we add another row below the $n + 1$ row, and name the squares as $a_0, a_1, \\cdots a_{n+1}$. We obtain that $x_0 = a_0 + a_1, x_1 = a_1 + a_2, \\cdots x_{n} = a_{n} + a_{n+1}$, and using the assumption, yield the top square equals ${n\\choose0}(a_0 + a_1) + {n\\choose1}(a_1 + a_2) + \\ldots {n\\choose{n}}(a_{n} + a_{n+1})$. While it's easy to prove that ${n\\choose{k}} + {n\\choose{k+1}} = {n+1\\choose{k+1}}$ (just expand it), we find that the two equations are identical.\n Note contributed by MVP_Harry, friend me if you want ~",

If we distribute 1 to $\\frac{3}{x-3}$, then the fraction becomes of the form $\\frac{x}{x - 3}$. A similar cancellation happens with the other four terms. If we assume $x = 0$ is not the highest solution (which is true given the answer format) we can cancel the common factor of $x$ from both sides of the equation.\n$\\frac{1}{x - 3} + \\frac{1}{x - 5} + \\frac{1}{x - 17} + \\frac{1}{x - 19} = x - 11$\n Then, if we make the substitution $y = x - 11$, we can further simplify.\n$\\frac{1}{y + 8} + \\frac{1}{y + 6} + \\frac{1}{y - 6} + \\frac{1}{y - 8} =y$\n If we group and combine the terms of the form $y - n$ and $y + n$, we get this equation:\n$\\frac{2y}{y^2 - 64} + \\frac{2y}{y^2 - 36} = y$\n Then, we can cancel out a $y$ from both sides, knowing that $x = 11$ is not a possible solution given the answer format. After we do that, we can make the final substitution $z = y^2$.\n$\\frac{2}{z - 64} + \\frac{2}{z - 36} = 1$\n$2z - 128 + 2z - 72 = (z - 64)(z - 36)$\n$4z - 200 = z^2 - 100z + 64(36)$\n$z^2 - 104z + 2504 = 0$\n Using the quadratic formula, we get that the largest solution for $z$ is $z = 52 + 10\\sqrt{2}$.

        "problem": "Steve says to Jon, \"I am thinking of a polynomial whose roots are all positive integers. The polynomial has the form $P(x) = 2x^3-2ax^2+(a^2-81)x-c$ for some positive integers $a$ and $c$. Can you tell me the values of $a$ and $c$?\"\n After some calculations, Jon says, \"There is more than one such polynomial.\"\n Steve says, \"You're right. Here is the value of $a$.\" He writes down a positive integer and asks, \"Can you tell me the value of $c$?\"\n Jon says, \"There are still two possible values of $c$.\"\n Find the sum of the two possible values of $c$.",
        "solution": "Since each of the roots is positive, the local maximum of the function must occur at a positive value of $x$. Taking $\\frac{d}{dx}$ of the polynomial yields $6x^2-4ax+a^2-81$, which is equal to $0$ at the local maximum. Since this is a quadratic in $a$, we can find an expression for $a$ in terms of $x$. The quadratic formula gives $a=\\frac{4x\\pm\\sqrt{324-8x^2}}{2}$, which simplifies to $a=2x\\pm\\sqrt{81-2x^2}$. We know that $a$ is a positive integer, and testing small positive integer values of $x$ yields $a=15$ or $a=1$ when $x=4$, and $a=15$ or $a=9$ when $x=6$. Because the value of $a$ alone does not determine the polynomial, $a$, $a$ must equal $15$.\n Now our polynomial equals $2x^3-30x^2+144x-c$. Because one root is less than (or equal to) the $x$ value at the local maximum (picture the graph of a cubic equation), it suffices to synthetically divide by small integer values of $x$ to see if the resulting quadratic also has positive integer roots. Dividing by $x=3$ leaves a quotient of $2x^2-24x+72=2(x-6)^2$, and dividing by $x=4$ leaves a quotient of $2x^2-22x+56=2(x-4)(x-7)$.
