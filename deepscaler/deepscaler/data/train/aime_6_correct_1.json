        "problem": "In a tournament each player played exactly one game against each of the other players. In each game the winner was awarded $1$ point, the loser got $0$ points, and each of the two players earned $\\frac{1}{2}$ point if the game was a tie. After the completion of the tournament, it was found that exactly half of the points earned by each player were earned against the ten players with the least number of points. (In particular, each of the ten lowest scoring players earned half of her/his points against the other nine of the ten). What was the total number of players in the tournament?",
        "solution": "Suppose that there are $n$ players participating in the tournament. We break this up into a group of the weakest ten, and the other $n-10$ people. Note that the $10$ players who played each other generated a total of $\\dbinom{10}{2} = 45$ points playing each other. Thus, they earned $45$ playing the $n-10$ other people. Thus, the $n-10$ people earned a total of $10(n-10)-45 = 10n-145$ points playing vs. this group of 10 people, and also earned a total of $10n-145$ playing against themselves. Since each match gives a total of one point, we must have that $\\dbinom{n-10}{2}=10n-145$. Expanding and simplifying gives us $n^2-41n+400=0$. Thus, $n=16$ or $n=25$. Note however that if $n=16$, then the strongest $16$ people get a total of $16*10-145=15$ playing against the weakest $10$ who gained $45$ points vs them, which is a contradiction since it must be larger. Thus, $n=\\boxed{25}$.\n Solution by GameMaster402",
