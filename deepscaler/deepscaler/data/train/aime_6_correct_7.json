It so happens that, when two socks are selected randomly without replacement, there is a probability of exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$ that both are red or both are blue. What is the largest possible number of red socks in the drawer that is consistent with this data?",
        "solution": "Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks such that $r+b\\le1991$. Then by complementary counting, the number of ways to get a red and a blue sock must be equal to $1-\\frac12=\\frac12=\\frac{2rb}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}\\implies4rb=(r+b)(r+b-1)$ $=(r+b)^2-(r+b)\\implies r^2+2rb+b^2-r-b=4rb\\implies r^2-2rb+b^2$ $=(r-b)^2=r+b$, so $r+b$ must be a perfect square $k^2$. Clearly, $r=\\frac{k^2+k}2$, so the larger $k$, the larger $r$: $k^2=44^2$ is the largest perfect square below $1991$, and our answer is $\\frac{44^2+44}2=\\frac12\\cdot44(44+1)=22\\cdot45=11\\cdot90=\\boxed{990}$.",

        "solution": "We define $Q(x)=P(x)-x+7$, noting that it has roots at $17$ and $24$. Hence $P(x)-x+7=A(x-17)(x-24)$. In particular, this means that $P(x)-x-3=A(x-17)(x-24)-10$. Therefore, $x=n_1,n_2$ satisfy $A(x-17)(x-24)=10$, where $A$, $(x-17)$, and $(x-24)$ are integers. This cannot occur if $x\\le 17$ or $x\\ge 24$ because the product $(x-17)(x-24)$ will either be too large or not be a divisor of $10$.

        "solution": "Because the order of the $a$'s doesn't matter, we simply need to find the number of $1$s $2$s $3$s and $4$s that minimize $S_2$. So let $w, x, y,$ and $z$ represent the number of $1$s, $2$s, $3$s, and $4$s respectively. Then we can write three equations based on these variables. Since there are a total of $350$ $a$s, we know that $w + x + y + z = 350$. We also know that $w + 2x + 3y + 4z = 513$ and $w + 16x + 81y + 256z = 4745$. We can now solve these down to two variables: \\[w = 350 - x - y - z\\] Substituting this into the second and third equations, we get \\[x + 2y + 3z = 163\\] and \\[15x + 80y + 255z = 4395.\\] The second of these can be reduced to \\[3x + 16y + 51z = 879.\\] Now we substitute $x$ from the first new equation into the other new equation. \\[x = 163 - 2y - 3z\\] \\[3(163 - 2y - 3z) + 16y + 51z = 879\\] \\[489 + 10y + 42z = 879\\] \\[5y + 21z = 195\\] Since $y$ and $z$ are integers, the two solutions to this are $(y,z) = (39,0)$ or $(18,5)$. If you plug both these solutions in to $S_2$ it is apparent that the second one returns a smaller value. It turns out that $w = 215$, $x = 112$, $y = 18$, and $z = 5$, so $S_2 = 215 + 4*112 + 9*18 + 16*5 = 215 + 448 + 162 + 80 = \\boxed{905}$.",

The ten element directly expands to $10D_{n-1}$. The three element expands to 3 times the determinant of the the matrix formed from omitting the second column and first row from the original matrix. Call this matrix $X_{n}$. $X_{n}$ has a first column entirely of zeros except for the first element, which is a three. A property of matrices is that the determinant can be expanded over the rows instead of the columns (still using the recursive definition as given in the problem), and the determinant found will still be the same. Thus, expanding over this first column yields $3D_{n-2} + 0(\\text{other things})=3D_{n-2}$. Thus, the $3 \\det(X_{n})$ expression turns into $9D_{n-2}$. Thus, the equation $D_{n}=10D_{n-1}-9D_{n-2}$ holds for all n > 2.\n This equation can be rewritten as $D_{n}=10(D_{n-1}-D_{n-2}) + D_{n-2}$. This version of the equation involves the difference of successive terms of a recursive sequence. Calculating $D_{0}$ backwards from the recursive formula and $D_{4}$ from the formula yields $D_{0}=1, D_{4}=7381$. Examining the differences between successive terms, a pattern emerges. $D_{0}=1=9^{0}$, $D_{1}-D_{0}=10-1=9=9^{1}$, $D_{2}-D_{1}=91-10=81=9^{2}$, $D_{3}-D_{2}=820-91=729=9^{3}$, $D_{4}-D_{3}=7381-820=6561=9^{4}$. Thus, $D_{n}=D_{0} + 9^{1}+9^{2}+ . . . +9^{n}=\\sum_{i=0}^{n}9^{i}=\\frac{(1)(9^{n+1}-1)}{9-1}=\\frac{9^{n+1}-1}{8}$.\n Thus, the desired sum is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{8\\frac{9^{n+1}-1}{8}+1}=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{9^{n+1}-1+1} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{9^{n+1}}$\n This is an infinite geometric series with first term $\\frac{1}{81}$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{9}$. Thus, the sum is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{81}}{1-\\frac{1}{9}}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{81}}{\\frac{8}{9}}=\\frac{9}{(81)(8)}=\\frac{1}{(9)(8)}=\\frac{1}{72}$.\n Thus, $p + q = 1 + 72 = \\boxed{073}$.",
