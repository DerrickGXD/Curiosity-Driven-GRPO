Let me reread the problem to make sure I understand all the given information.\n\nIn quadrilateral ABCD, we have two angle congruencies: angle BAD is congruent to angle ADC, and angle ABD is congruent to angle BCD. The sides AB and BD are given as 8 and 10 units respectively, and BC is 6 units. We need to find the length of CD, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then determine m + n.\n\nOkay, so first, I'll try to sketch quadrilateral ABCD based on the given information. I know that AB is 8, BD is 10, BC is 6, and CD is what we're finding.\n\nWait, BD is a diagonal, right? So BD connects vertex B to vertex D. Also, given the angle congruencies, maybe triangles ABD and CDB are similar? Hmm. Let me note that.\n\nGiven that angle BAD ≅ angle ADC, so ∠BAD is equal to ∠ADC. Also, angle ABD ≅ angle BCD, so ∠ABD ≅ ∠BCD.\n\nSo, in triangle ABD, angle ABD is equal to angle BCD. Triangle ABC... Hmm, not sure. Maybe triangle BCD too.\n\nWait, let me think about labeling all the points and the angles.\n\nLet me attempt to sketch quadrilateral ABCD. Let me imagine point A, then from A, sides AB and AD. Since angle BAD is equal to angle ADC. Hmm.\n\nI think drawing a diagram might help too, but since I'm just doing this mentally, I should outline what angle congruencies tell us.\n\nIn triangle ABD, we have angle at A, the angle BAD, which is congruent to angle ADC in triangle ADC. Also, angle ABD (which is angle at B in triangle ABD) is congruent to angle BCD, which is angle at C in triangle BCD.\n\nHmm. Let me label the known lengths: AB is 8, BD is 10, BC is 6, and CD is unknown.\n\nSo, perhaps triangles ABD and BCD have some similarities? Let me see.\n\nWait, but angle at B is shared in triangle ABD and angle at C in triangle BCD. So, is there a way to apply the trigonometric ratio or something here?\n\nAlternatively, is this an application of the Law of Sines or Cosines? Maybe, because we have sides and some angles.\n\nLet me consider triangle ABD first. We know AB = 8, BD = 10. We don't know angle at A or angle at B, but angle BAD is congruent to angle ADC.\n\nWait, so angle BAD is congruent to angle ADC. Let me denote angle BAD as α, so angle ADC is also α. Similarly, angle ABD is congruent to angle BCD, let's denote both as β.\n\nOkay, so in triangle ABD, we have two angles: angle BAD = α and angle ABD = β. So the third angle, angle ADB, is 180° - α - β.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BCD, we have angle BCD = β and angle CDB and angle CBD. Hmm.\n\nWait, in triangle BCD, we already have angle BCD = β, and angle CDB is a part of the quadrilateral.\n\nHold on, maybe triangles ABD and CDB are similar? If so, that might help. Let me check if their angles are equal.\n\nIn triangle ABD: angles are α, β, and 180 - α - β.\n\nIn triangle BCD: angles are β, some angle at D (which I think is angle CDB), and some other angle...\n\nWait, but angle ADB in triangle ABD is equal to angle CBD in triangle BCD, perhaps? Because angle ADB is 180 - α - β, and if in triangle BCD, angle CBD is adjacent.\n\nI might need to consider whether the two triangles are similar by AAA or something. Let me check.\n\nFor triangles ABD and BCD: in triangle ABD, angle BAD = α, angle ABD = β, and in triangle BCD, angle BCD = β. So, they share angle BCD in a way that might not directly.\n\nWait, point D has angle ADC = α. So perhaps in triangle ADC, angle at D is α as well. So maybe triangle ADC has angle at D equal to triangle ABD has angle at D.\n\nWait, triangle ABD: angle at D is 180 - α - β. Triangle ADC: angle at D is α.\n\nHmm, not sure if they share the same angle. Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: let me consider that diagonals BD intersect AC, but actually, in quadrilaterals, diagonals might or might not intersect, but in this case, since we're dealing with triangles, we can think about the triangles split by the diagonal BD.\n\nSo, quadrilateral ABCD is split into two triangles: ABD and BCD by diagonal BD. So, if we can find some relation between these triangles... Wait, but not all sides are known.\n\nGiven that AB = 8, BD =10, BC=6, CD is unknown.\n\nAlso, angle BAD ≅ angle ADC.\n\nWait, angle BAD is at A, between AB and AD, and angle ADC is at D, between AD and DC. So, points: point A is connected to B and D, and A is also connected to point C. Similarly, point D is connected to A, B, and C.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can use the Law of Sines on triangle ABD and triangle BCD.\n\nIn triangle ABD: sides AB=8, BD=10, angle at A is α, angle at B is β, angle at D is 180 - α - β.\n\nIn triangle BCD: sides BD=10, BC=6, angle at C is β, angle at D is something, angle at B is something else.\n\nWait, is angle at D in triangle BCD the same as angle at D in triangle ABD? Let me see.\n\nIn quadrilateral ABCD, the diagonal BD splits the quadrilateral into triangles ABD and BCD. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that sides AB and AD, and sides BD and DC.\n\nWait, in triangle ABD: sides AB = 8, BD = 10, AD is unknown.\n\nIn triangle BCD: sides BC = 6, BD =10, CD is unknown. Angle at C is equal to angle at B which is β.\n\nWait, so in triangle BCD, angle at C is β, side opposite to ∠B is BD, which is 10. Wait, no, side BD is 10, which is between points B and D, so in triangle BCD, side opposite angle C is BD = 10.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ABD, side AD is opposite to angle B, which is β.\n\nWait, maybe I need to express the sides of triangles ABD and BCD in terms of sides and angles. Let me write the Law of Sines for both triangles.\n\nFor triangle ABD:\n\nIn triangle ABD, sides: AB=8, BD=10, angle at A (BAD)=α, angle at B (ABD)=β, angle at D (∠ADB)=180° - α - β.\n\nBy the Law of Sines:\n\nAB / sin(∠ADB) = BD / sin(∠BAD) = AD / sin(∠ABD)\n\nSo:\n\n8 / sin(180 - α - β) = 10 / sin α = AD / sin β\n\nSimilarly, but sin(180 - x) = sin x, so sin(180 - α - β) = sin(α + β).\n\nSo, from the above ratios:\n\n8 / sin(α + β) = 10 / sin α.\n\nCross-multiplying: 8 sin α = 10 sin(α + β).\n\nSimilarly, Ratio: 8 / sin(alpha + beta) = 6 / sin(angle at D) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's just work with the first ratio for now.\n\nSo,\n\n8 / sin(alpha + beta) = 10 / sin alpha\n\n=> sin(alpha) * 8 = sin(alpha + beta) * 10\n\nHmm. Keep that in mind.\n\nNow, looking at triangle BCD.\n\nWe have triangle BCD with sides BC=6, BD=10, CD is unknown. Angles:\n\nAt point C: angle BCD = beta.\n\nAt point B: which angle? I think it's angle CBD. In triangle BCD, the angles are:\n\nAngle at C: beta,\n\nAngle at B: let's denote it as gamma,\n\nAngle at D: whatever is left at 180 - beta - gamma.\n\nGiven that, maybe we can apply the Law of Sines again.\n\nLaw of Sines in triangle BCD:\n\nBC / sin(angle at D) = BD / sin(beta) = CD / sin(gamma)\n\nSo, 6 / sin(angle D) = 10 / sin(beta) = CD / sin(gamma)\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ABD, angle at D is angle ADB = 180 - alpha - beta, so the same angle is consistent in triangle ABC? Not quite, because in triangle ABD, angle at D is angle ADB, while in triangle BCD, angle at D is angle BDC.\n\nWait, are angles at D in both triangles the same? Probably not, unless points A, C, and D are colinear, which they are not.\n\nWait, but if I look at both triangles ABD and BCD, both have side BD, side AD (in triangle ABD) and BC (in triangle BCD). So, need a better approach.\n\nWait another thought: since angle BAD ≅ angle ADC.\n\nIn other words, angle at A in triangle ABD is congruent to angle at D in triangle ADC. Similarly, in triangle ABC and triangle ADC, but mind you, in our quadrilateral, point C is connected to D as well.\n\nWait, triangle ADC: we have sides AD, DC, and AC. We have angle at D: angle ADC ≅ angle BAD.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ABD, the angle at D is angle ADB, triangle ADC, angle at D is angle ADC.\n\nWait, but angle ADB and angle ADC are different angles unless point B is colinear with C, which is not the case.\n\nWait, no, because point C is connected to D, but point B is connected to D as the diagonal.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck a bit here.\n\nPerhaps I can assign variables to the unknown angles and sides to form equations.\n\nSo, in triangle ABD, let me denote angle ABD as beta, as given. So angle ABD = beta.\n\nTherefore, angle ADB = 180 - alpha - beta.\n\nIn triangle ABD, by Law of Sines:\n\nAB / sin(angle ADB) = BD / sin(alpha) = AD / sin(beta)\n\nSo, as we wrote earlier, 8 / sin(alpha + beta) = 10 / sin(alpha) = AD / sin(beta)\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ABD, maybe we can create another relationship.\n\nSo, 8 / sin(alpha + beta) = 10 / sin(alpha)\n\nSo,\n\n8 sin(alpha) = 10 sin(alpha + beta)  [1]\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BCD, we have sides BC=6, BD=10, and CD=?\n\nQuartering the angles: in triangle BCD, angles at C, B, D; at C: angle BCD = beta, at B: we don't know, and at D: we don't know. But perhaps it's related to angle at D in triangle ABD.\n\nWait, probably need to use triangle relationships between ABD and BCD.\n\nHold on, maybe I can apply the ratio because we have two triangles with a common diagonal.\n\nWait, in triangle ABD and triangle CDB, both share the diagonal BD=10. Maybe by Law of Sines on points A, C, since there are angles equal?\n\nAlternatively, is there a proportion we can get from the triangles?\n\nWait, using the Law of Sines in triangles ABD and BCD.\n\nIn triangle ABD: sides AB=8, BD=10, AD is side we don't know.\n\nIn triangle ABD, using Law of Sines:\n\nAD / sin(beta) = BD / sin(alpha) = 8 / sin(angle ADB)\n\nWait, AD / sin(beta) = 10 / sin(alpha)\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BCD:\n\nCD / sin(angle at D) = BC / sin(angle at D of BCD)\n\nWait, maybe too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: considering the quadrilateral, maybe using properties like triangle areas or something similar."]}
