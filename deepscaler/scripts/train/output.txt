Okay, so I have this problem about a cube with side length 10 suspended above a plane. The vertex closest to the plane is labeled A. The three vertices adjacent to A are at heights 10, 11, and 12 above the plane. I need to find the distance from A to the plane, express it in the form (r - sqrt(s))/t, and then find the sum r + s + t. \n\nLet me try to visualize this. A cube has all edges of equal length, so each edge is 10 units. Vertex A is the closest to the plane, so the other three vertices connected to A (let's call them B, C, D) are each 10 units away along the edges from A. The heights of these three vertices above the plane are given: 10, 11, and 12. So, the three adjacent vertices are at different distances from the plane.\n\nI think it might help to assign coordinates to the cube. Let me choose a coordinate system where vertex A is at some point (x, y, z), and the plane is given by an equation, say, ax + by + cz + d = 0. The distance from a point (x, y, z) to the plane is |ax + by + cz + d| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). But since we don't know the equation of the plane, maybe I can use some relative distances.\n\nAlternatively, since the cube is suspended above the plane, the three adjacent vertices are at 10, 11, and 12 units above the plane. So, these vertices are along different edges from A. Let me denote the distance from A to the plane as h. Then, the distances from the adjacent vertices (B, C, D) to the plane would be h plus some component of the edge length along the normal vector of the plane.\n\nWait, maybe that's the key. If I consider the normal vector of the plane, the distances from the adjacent vertices will differ by the dot product of the edge vector with the plane's normal vector. Since edges of the cube are perpendicular to each other, the differences in heights correspond to the projections along the normal vector.\n\nLet me define the normal vector to the plane as vector n = (p, q, r). Then, the distance from A to the plane is h, so the distance from B, which is along the edge AB (let's say, along the x-axis from A), to the plane would be h + p*10, because moving along the x-axis by 10 units changes the distance by p*10.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from C, which is along the edge AC (say, the y-axis), would be h + q*10, and the distance from D, along the edge AD (z-axis), would be h + r*10.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the heights of B, C, D are 10, 11, 12. So, depending on the direction, the edges could be moving in the direction of the normal vector or against it. But since the vertex closest to the plane is A, the edges go away from the plane, right? So, the height increases as we move along the edges from A.\n\nTherefore, the distances from B, C, D should be h + 10p, h + 10q, h + 10r, respectively. But which one is which? Since the heights are 10, 11, 12, we need to figure out which corresponds to h + 10p, h + 10q, h + 10r.\n\nBut p, q, r are direction cosines, meaning p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 1, since they are components of a unit vector. So, h + 10p, h + 10q, h + 10r are three numbers: 10, 11, 12 in some order.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equations:\n\nh + 10p = a,\n\nh + 10q = b,\n\nh + 10r = c,\n\nwhere {a, b, c} = {10, 11, 12}.\n\nSo, subtracting h from all:\n\n10p = a - h,\n\n10q = b - h,\n\n10r = c - h.\n\nThen, since p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 1, we can write:\n\n[(a - h)/10]^2 + [(b - h)/10]^2 + [(c - h)/10]^2 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n[(a - h)^2 + (b - h)^2 + (c - h)^2] / 100 = 1,\n\nso,\n\n(a - h)^2 + (b - h)^2 + (c - h)^2 = 100.\n\nNow, depending on which of a, b, c is h + 10p, etc., the terms will vary. But since all a, b, c are 10, 11, 12, we can plug them in.\n\nLet me let a, b, c be 10, 11, 12 in some order.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(10 - h)^2 + (11 - h)^2 + (12 - h)^2 = 100.\n\nWait, is this correct? Because if p, q, r are direction cosines, then p, q, r could be positive or negative, but since we have the distances increasing, it's likely that h is less than a, b, c, so 10,11,12 are above h. Hence, 10 - h, 11 - h, 12 - h are positive. So, the equation is correct.\n\nTherefore, expanding:\n\n(10 - h)^2 + (11 - h)^2 + (12 - h)^2 = 100.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n(10 - h)^2 = h^2 - 20h + 100,\n\n(11 - h)^2 = h^2 - 22h + 121,\n\n(12 - h)^2 = h^2 - 24h + 144.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n3h^2 - (20 + 22 + 24)h + (100 + 121 + 144) = 100.\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\n20 + 22 + 24 = 66,\n\n100 + 121 + 144 = 365.\n\nSo,\n\n3h^2 - 66h + 365 = 100.\n\nSubtract 100:\n\n3h^2 - 66h + 265 = 0.\n\nDivide equation by GCD 1, so it's 3h^2 -66h +265 = 0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation for h.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nh = [66 ± sqrt(66^2 - 4*3*265)] / (2*3)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n66^2 = 4356,\n\n4*3*265 = 12*265 = 3180,\n\nSo discriminant is 4356 - 3180 = 1176.\n\nsqrt(1176). Let's see, 1176 divided by 4 is 294, which divided by 4 is 73.5, which is not a perfect square. Wait, 1176 = 49*24, because 49*24=1176. And sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6). So, sqrt(1176)=sqrt(49*24)=7*2*sqrt(6)=14*sqrt(6).\n\nThus, h = [66 ±14*sqrt(6)] / 6.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFactor numerator: 66 and 14 have a common factor of 2.\n\n66 = 2*33,\n\n14 = 2*7,\n\nSo, factor out 2:\n\nh = [2*(33 ±7*sqrt(6))]/6 = (33 ±7*sqrt(6))/3.\n\nSo, h = 11 ± (7*sqrt(6))/3.\n\nNow, which sign to take? Since h is the distance from A to the plane, and the adjacent vertices are at 10,11,12, which are all above h, so h must be less than 10, 11, 12.\n\nWait, but h is a distance, so it's positive, and the normal vector points outward, so h is less than the heights of the adjacent vertices.\n\nBut 11 ± (7*sqrt(6))/3. Let's compute 7*sqrt(6)/3.\n\nsqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 7*2.449≈17.143, divide by 3≈5.714.\n\nThus, h = 11 ±5.714.\n\nSo, h ≈11 +5.714≈16.714 or h≈11 -5.714≈5.286.\n\nBut the adjacent vertices are at 10,11,12, so h must be less than 10, since A is the closest. So, h≈5.286, which is about 5.286, which is 33 -7*sqrt(6)/3. Wait, 33 /3 is 11, and 7*sqrt(6)/3 is ~5.714, so 11 -5.714≈5.286.\n\nWait, but 33 -7*sqrt(6) is approximately 33 -17.143≈15.857, divided by 3≈5.286. So, h is approximately 5.286.\n\nBut we can write it exactly as (33 -7*sqrt(6))/3. So, h = (33 -7*sqrt(6))/3. Which can be written as (33 - sqrt(294))/3, since 7^2*6=294. So, h = (33 - sqrt(294))/3. But that can be simplified more? Let me see.\n\nsqrt(294) can be simplified as sqrt(49*6)=7*sqrt(6). So, h=(33 -7*sqrt(6))/3. So, in the form (r - sqrt(s))/t, where r=33, s=294, t=3.\n\nBut wait, 294 can be simplified, as 294=49*6, so sqrt(294)=7*sqrt(6). So, h=(33 -7*sqrt(6))/3, which is equal to (33 - sqrt(294))/3. But 294 is 49*6, so sqrt(294)=7*sqrt(6). So, maybe the expression can be written as (33 - sqrt(294))/3, but that's not simplified in terms of minimal s.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as (33 -7*sqrt(6))/3, since 7*sqrt(6) is sqrt(294). So, it's the same as (33 - sqrt(294))/3.\n\nBut the problem says it can be expressed as (r - sqrt(s))/t, so r=33, s=294, t=3. Then, r + s + t=33 +294 +3=330.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, is h = (33 -7*sqrt(6))/3? Yes, because we had 14*sqrt(6)/6=7*sqrt(6)/3, so sqrt(294) is 7*sqrt(6), so sqrt(294)=7*sqrt(6). So, yes, h=(33 - sqrt(294))/3.\n\nBut 294 can be simplified? 294 is 49*6, so sqrt(294)=7*sqrt(6). So, h=(33 -7*sqrt(6))/3. So, that's equal to (33)/3 - (7*sqrt(6))/3=11 - (7/3)*sqrt(6). Hmm, but the question says expressed as (r - sqrt(s))/t, so that's (33 - sqrt(294))/3, but I think the standard form is to have s square-free. So, since 294 is not square-free, we can write it as 14*sqrt(6) or something else. Wait, sqrt(294)=sqrt(49*6)=7*sqrt(6). So, if we write h=(33 -7*sqrt(6))/3, that's also valid.\n\nSo, in that case, r=33, s=294, t=3, so sum is 33+294+3=330. But is 294 square-free? Wait, 294=49*6, so sqrt(294)=7*sqrt(6), which is simplified. So, perhaps s=6, and r=33, t=3, so then h=(33 - sqrt(6))/3, but no, because 7*sqrt(6) is sqrt(294). So, perhaps the correct way is (33 - sqrt(294))/3, which is (33 - sqrt(294))/3.\n\nBut the problem says \"distance from vertex A to the plane can be expressed as (r - sqrt(s))/t\", so I think 33 and 294 are both integers, so that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have thought differently about the setup. Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that the edges are along the coordinate axes. Hmmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the cube is not axis-aligned with the coordinate system. So, the cube is placed in 3D space, and the plane is arbitrary. Therefore, the edges from A are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes. So, in my initial approach, I assumed they are, but maybe that's an incorrect assumption.\n\nWait, but in reality, the cube is a 3D object, and the plane is arbitrary. So, the distances from the vertices to the plane depend on the orientation of the cube relative to the plane. So, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nLet me think. Let me denote the normal vector to the plane as (a, b, c), unit vector. Then, the distance from a point (x, y, z) to the plane is |a x + b y + c z + d|, where d is some constant. The distance from A, which is at some point (0,0,0) for simplicity, would be |d|, since the plane equation is ax + by + cz + d =0, and A is (0,0,0). Wait, but actually, if I place A at (0,0,0), then the distance from A to the plane is |d| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). But perhaps it's better to place the plane in such a way that the distance from A is h, so the plane is ax + by + cz + (-a h - b h - c h) =0. So, the distance from A is | -a h - b h - c h | / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) )= |h ( -a -b -c )| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). But if I set A at (0,0,0), then the plane equation is ax + by + cz + d =0, so the distance from A is |d| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).\n\nSo, without loss of generality, I can set d = -h, so the plane equation is ax + by + cz - h = 0, so distance from A is | -h | / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = h / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).\n\nBut then, the adjacent vertices B, C, D are at (10,0,0), (0,10,0), (0,0,10). Their distances to the plane are |a*10 + b*0 + c*0 - h| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = |10a - h| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2), similarly for the others.\n\nSo, for vertex B, distance is |10a - h| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, for vertex C: |10b - h| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)=11,\n\nand for vertex D: |10c - h| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)=12.\n\nAssuming the cube is oriented such that edges AB, AC, AD are along the coordinate axes, which is a common way to model cubes, but in reality, the cube could be oriented arbitrarily, so I need to be careful.\n\nBut in this case, since the cube is suspended above the plane, and the adjacent vertices are at 10,11,12, it's likely that the cube is oriented such that the edges from A are along each axis, making the coordinate system with A at (0,0,0) and edges to B, C, D along x, y, z.\n\nThus, in that case, the distances from B, C, D to the plane are |10a - h| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2), etc.\n\nBut since the edges are along the axes, the normal vector components a, b, c correspond to the direction of the cube's edges, so a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1, because it's a unit vector.\n\nTherefore, distance from B is |10a - h|, since sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)=1.\n\nSimilarly, distance from C is |10b - h|, and distance from D is |10c - h|.\n\nSo, the three equations are:\n\n|10a - h| =10,\n\n|10b - h|=11,\n\n|10c - h|=12.\n\nSince the vertices are above the plane, and the cube is suspended, I think h is less than 10,11,12, so 10a > h, 10b > h, 10c > h. Therefore, the absolute values can be removed without considering the sign.\n\nThus,\n\n10a - h =10,\n\n10b - h=11,\n\n10c - h=12.\n\nTherefore,\n\na = (h +10)/10,\n\nb=(h +11)/10,\n\nc=(h +12)/10.\n\nBut since a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1, because they are direction cosines.\n\nSo,\n\n[(h +10)/10]^2 + [(h +11)/10]^2 + [(h +12)/10]^2 =1.\n\nCompute:\n\n[(h^2 +20h +100) + (h^2 +22h +121) + (h^2 +24h +144)] / 100 =1.\n\nCombine numerator:\n\n3h^2 + (20h +22h +24h) + (100 +121 +144)= 3h^2 +66h +365.\n\nThus,\n\n(3h^2 +66h +365)/100 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\n3h^2 +66h +365=100,\n\nSo,\n\n3h^2 +66h +265=0.\n\nWait, this is the same quadratic equation I had earlier. So, the quadratic is the same.\n\nSo, solving this, h = [ -66 ± sqrt(66^2 -4*3*265) ]/(2*3) = [ -66 ± sqrt(4356 - 3180) ]/6 = [ -66 ± sqrt(1176) ]/6.\n\nsqrt(1176)=sqrt(49*24)=7*sqrt(24)=7*2*sqrt(6)=14*sqrt(6).\n\nSo, h=( -66 ±14*sqrt(6) )/6.\n\nWhich simplifies to h= (-33 ±7*sqrt(6))/3.\n\nNow, since h is a distance, it must be positive. So, we take the positive solution:\n\nh=( -33 +7*sqrt(6) )/3.\n\nBut wait, 7*sqrt(6)≈17.143, so -33 +17.143≈-15.857, which is negative. That can't be, because h is a distance above the plane, so h must be positive.\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the signs.\n\nEarlier, I assumed that 10a - h=10, 10b -h=11, 10c -h=12. But if the distances are 10,11,12, which are all greater than h, so 10a > h, 10b >h, 10c >h, so 10a -h is positive. Therefore, 10a -h=10, etc.\n\nBut then, as above, that gives h=( -33 +7*sqrt(6) )/3≈(-33 +17.143)/3≈(-15.857)/3≈-5.286, which is negative. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the assumption that 10a - h=10, etc., is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the distance is |10a - h|=10, so 10a - h could be 10 or -10.\n\nBut since the vertex is above the plane, the normal vector points away from the plane, so 10a - h would be positive? Let me think.\n\nWait, the distance is |10a - h|, but if the cube is suspended above the plane, the normal vector is pointing outwards from the cube, so if we have the plane, and the cube above it, the normal vector from the plane to the cube is pointing away from the plane. Therefore, if the cube is above the plane, for each edge, the dot product of the edge vector with the plane's normal vector should be positive.\n\nThus, if the cube is suspended above the plane, then for each edge from A, the dot product of the edge vector with the normal vector is positive. So, the normal vector points away from the plane, so the direction from the plane to the cube is in the direction of the normal vector.\n\nTherefore, if I take the normal vector as (a, b, c), then the edges from A, which are along positive a, positive b, positive c, would have a positive dot product with the normal vector.\n\nThus, for vertex B, which is along positive a-axis, the dot product (1,0,0)·(a,b,c)=a, which is positive.\n\nSimilarly, for vertex C, (0,1,0)·(a,b,c)=b, positive, and D, (0,0,1)·(a,b,c)=c, positive.\n\nTherefore, 10a, 10b, 10c are positive, so 10a - h=10, 10b -h=11, 10c -h=12.\n\nWait, but that leads to h=( -33 +sqrt(294) )/3, but that's negative.\n\nWait, but if 10a - h=10, then h=10a -10.\n\nSimilarly, h=10b -11, and h=10c -12.\n\nSo, 10a -10 =10b -11=10c -12.\n\nTherefore, 10a= h +10,\n\n10b= h +11,\n\n10c= h +12.\n\nTherefore, a=(h +10)/10,\n\nb=(h +11)/10,\n\nc=(h +12)/10.\n\nThen, since a^2 + b^2 + c^2=1,\n\n[(h +10)^2 + (h +11)^2 + (h +12)^2]/100=1,\n\nWhich gives the same equation as before.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(h^2 +20h +100) + (h^2 +22h +121) + (h^2 +24h +144)=3h^2 +66h +365=100,\n\n3h^2 +66h +265=0.\n\nSo, same quadratic as before, leading to h=( -66 ±sqrt(1176) )/6.\n\nAs before, sqrt(1176)=14sqrt(6), so h=( -66 ±14sqrt(6) )/6.\n\nSimplify:\n\nh=( -33 ±7sqrt(6) )/3.\n\nSo, h=( -33 +7sqrt(6) )/3 or h=( -33 -7sqrt(6) )/3.\n\nBut since h must be positive, only h=( -33 +7sqrt(6) )/3 is possible, but as we saw, 7sqrt(6)≈17.143, so h≈( -33 +17.143)/3≈(-15.857)/3≈-5.286, which is negative. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps my assumption is wrong, that all 10a - h, 10b - h, 10c - h are positive.\n\nWait, but if h is positive, and 10a >h, 10b >h, 10c >h, then 10a -h, 10b -h, 10c -h are all positive. So, the quadratic equation must have a positive solution for h.\n\nBut in the solution, it's negative. Therefore, that suggests that my initial assumption that the distances are 10a -h=10, etc., is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the normal vector is such that the dot product is negative.\n\nWait, but if the normal vector points outwards from the cube, then for each edge from A, the dot product of the edge vector with the normal vector is positive, because the cube is above the plane.\n\nWait, maybe the normal vector points towards the cube, but from the plane. So, if the cube is above the plane, then the normal vector is pointing downwards from the plane. Therefore, the dot product of the edge vector with the plane's normal vector would be negative.\n\nHence, for each edge, the dot product is negative.\n\nTherefore, the distance is |10a - h| = h -10a, assuming h >10a.\n\nSimilarly, 10b - h = h -10b,\n\n10c - h = h -10c.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the cube is above the plane, the edges are pointing away from the plane, so the dot product of the edge with the normal vector is negative, so the distance would be h -10a, h -10b, h -10c.\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\nh -10a =10,\n\nh -10b=11,\n\nh -10c=12.\n\nSo, solving:\n\na=(h -10)/10,\n\nb=(h -11)/10,\n\nc=(h -12)/10.\n\nThen, since a^2 + b^2 + c^2=1,\n\n[(h -10)^2 + (h -11)^2 + (h -12)^2]/100=1,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(h^2 -20h +100) + (h^2 -22h +121) + (h^2 -24h +144)=3h^2 -66h +365=100,\n\nThus, 3h^2 -66h +265=0.\n\nDivide by GCD 1: 3h^2 -66h +265=0.\n\nSolution:\n\nh = [66 ± sqrt(66^2 -4*3*265)]/(2*3)= [66 ± sqrt(4356 -3180)]/6= [66 ± sqrt(1176)]/6.\n\nsqrt(1176)=14sqrt(6), so h=(66 ±14sqrt(6))/6.\n\nSimplify:\n\nFactor numerator: 66=6*11, 14sqrt(6)=2*7sqrt(6). So,\n\nh=(66 ±14sqrt(6))/6= 11 ± (7sqrt(6))/3.\n\nTherefore, h=11 + (7sqrt(6))/3≈11 +5.714≈16.714,\n\nor h=11 - (7sqrt(6))/3≈11 -5.714≈5.286.\n\nBut since the distance h must be less than the adjacent vertices, which are at 10,11,12, so h must be less than 10. Therefore, h=11 - (7sqrt(6))/3≈5.286.\n\nSo, h=(33 -7sqrt(6))/3, as before.\n\nSo, same as before, h=(33 -7sqrt(6))/3.\n\nTherefore, in the form (r - sqrt(s))/t, where r=33, s=294, t=3.\n\nWait, but 7sqrt(6) is sqrt(49*6)=sqrt(294). So, h=(33 - sqrt(294))/3. Therefore, the distance is (33 - sqrt(294))/3.\n\nSo, r=33, s=294, t=3.\n\nSo, sum r+s+t=33+294+3=330.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, 7sqrt(6)=sqrt(49*6)=sqrt(294), yes.\n\nAlternatively, if we factor 294=49*6, so sqrt(294)=7sqrt(6). So, it's correct.\n\nThus, the answer is 330.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{330}\n</think>\n\nGiven a cube with side length 10 suspended above a plane, the vertex closest to the plane is labeled \\(A\\). The three vertices adjacent to \\(A\\) are at heights 10, 11, and 12 above the plane. We need to find the distance from vertex \\(A\\) to the plane, expressed as \\(\\frac{r - \\sqrt{s}}{t}\\), and then find the sum \\(r + s + t\\).\n\n1. **Setting up the problem**:\n   - Let \\(h\\) be the distance from vertex \\(A\\) to the plane.\n   - The distances from the adjacent vertices \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) to the plane are 10, 11, and 12 respectively.\n\n2. **Using direction cosines**:\n   - The normal vector to the plane is considered, and the distances from the vertices can be expressed in terms of the normal vector components.\n   - The distances from \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) to the plane are given by \\(|10a - h| = 10\\), \\(|10b - h| = 11\\), and \\(|10c - h| = 12\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the direction cosines.\n\n3. **Considering the correct signs**:\n   - Since the cube is suspended above the plane, the normal vector points outward, and the dot product of the edge vectors with the normal vector is positive.\n   - Thus, the distances are \\(h - 10 = 10\\), \\(h - 10 = 11\\), and \\(h - 10 = 12\\).\n\n4. **Solving the quadratic equation**:\n   - The equations are \\(h - 10 = 10\\), \\(h - 10 = 11\\), and \\(h - 10 = 12\\).\n   - This leads to solving the quadratic equation: \\(3h^2 - 66h + 265 = 0\\).\n\n5. **Finding the roots**:\n   - Solving the quadratic equation gives the roots \\(h = 11 + \\frac{7\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\) and \\(h = 11 - \\frac{7\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\).\n   - The correct root is \\(h = 11 - \\frac{7\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\).\n\n6. **Expressing the result**:\n   - The distance \\(h\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{33 - \\sqrt{294}}{3}\\).\n   - Here, \\(r = 33\\), \\(s = 294\\), and \\(t = 3\\).\n\n7. **Summing the values**:\n   - The sum \\(r + s + t = 33 + 294 + 3 = 330\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).
